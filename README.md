# FOMO_AD-with-Sony-Spresense
By using visual anomaly detection, it is possible to train ML models with images from ideal or normal product only. If an anomaly is found, the location of the anomaly can also be determined, so that you can immediately know which part is damaged or missing. Speed, efficiency, accuracy and ease of deployment are why we use FOMO-AD in this project.
